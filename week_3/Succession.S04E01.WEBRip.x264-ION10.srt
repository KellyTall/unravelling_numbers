No, I just wanted
to perform the ask, um,

177

out of due deference.

178
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,604
Uh, just in case of photos
or getting talked about or--

179
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,856
No, I'm sorry. You're--
you're-- you're asking me,

It's not a thing.

SHIV: <i>So, then
why are you letting me know?</i>

183
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,198
Because it's not business.

It's not a sexual thing.

SHIV: <i>And yet,
you are telling me.</i>

191
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,135
Because I bumped
into Marlinda, okay?

192
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,637
And, of course,
she got her little beak in,

193
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,222
so I had to tell her
it wasn't business

194
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,808

So, the headline is

Now, how are you all faring
in terms of your father?

829
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:24,010
Uh, we're fine.
It's just a complicated,

830
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:27,096
- private situation.
- Whereby we all hate him.

831
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,890
(LAUGHS) Well, look, it--

832
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,559
- Please, sit.
- ROMAN: Yeah.

833
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,022
NAN PIERCE:
Look, as you probably know...

834
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,358
we are talking with our bankers.

835
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,360
And we have a whole number of

836
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,155
very interesting proposals
to consider.

837
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,783
And I think it's all wrapped up.

838
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:51,203
So, I wanted to say
thank you for coming,

839
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:54,206
but I think
it's just a little bit too late.

840
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,541
We have a preferred bidder.

841
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:58,836
So, I hope that I have not
inconvenienced you.

842
00:38:58,836 --> 00:38:59,962
SHIV: Hmm.

843
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:03,090
Okay, well, lovely visit.
Great to see you guys.

844
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:06,427
(CHUCKLES) No, really.
I'm-- I am very sorry.

845
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,637
May I offer you some bottles?

846
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:11,098
They might as well be
jars of jam to me,

847
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,434
but the connoisseurs
seem to like them.

848
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,978
- I fear I have peasant tastes.
- (LAUGHS)

849
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,938
You don't want
to just hear the offer?

NAN: I got a taste
for <i>hypermarché vin ordinaire</i>

851
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,401
when I was 19 years old

852
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:25,112
and I have never been able
to shake it.

853
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:28,199
I like my wine thin
and vinegary.

854
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,910
- Like her men.
- ADVISER 1: (CHUCKLES) Naomi!

855
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:34,330
No, but really, I fear
it is a trip made in vain.

856
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,748
The other offer's just too good.

857
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:39,168
Listen, long story short, Nan.
You called this right before.

858
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:43,464
Yeah? Logan wants to take
your company and fuck it.

859
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:46,801
He loathes you and he wants
to take your properties

860
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,970
and roll them in the dirt.
And we wouldn't do that.

861
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,181
SHIV: Look, I think
that after this election,

862
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:57,061
we all, as a country,
could be in a very bad place.

863
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:00,439
And I could--
we would maintain your values.

864
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,566
That's all good and well,
but obviously,

865
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,568
with one thing and another,

866
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,404
we have a responsibility
to get the best possible deal

867
00:40:07,404 --> 00:40:08,948
for my family
and the other shareholders.

868
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,283
I'm confident that we can
be competitive on price.

869
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:15,788
Well, with Jamie's divorce
and Anne's disaster in Maine.

870
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:16,872
And this place.

871
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,878
How's your financing?
Not that I understand at all.

872
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:27,341
It's robust.
Tellis and our team
can talk to your people.

873
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,176
And in terms of your futures?

874
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,387
SHIV: Well, we've written
our resignation letters,

875
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:34,098
and the GoJo deal signs
in 48 hours.

876
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,850
Nevertheless,
you'd still be married

877
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,185
to the head of ATN.
That's a bit messy.

878
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:41,564
- I'm getting a divorce, so...
- NAN: Oh. 'Kay.

879
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:42,940
I'm sorry to hear that.

880
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,026

to talk numbers.

- KENDALL: Totally. Totally.

885
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,832
Shall we just say
our number, though?

886
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:03,919
Just see
if that makes any sense.

887
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,504
Oh, I don't like this.

888
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,841
Makes me feel like
I'm in the middle

889
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,050
of a bidding war.

890
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:15,181
Horrible. Different people
saying different numbers.

It's so confusing.

What comes after nine?

894
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,524
Nine B?

Listen, would you mind if, uh,
if we all had a brief chat?

ADVISER 2: Have you seen
the view from the terrace?
It's incredible.
